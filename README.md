# Hi, I'm Jarupula Prem Kumar 

### Senior Data Engineer | Data Platform Architect

I specialize in designing, deploying, and optimizing high-performance, multi-cloud data ecosystems built for massive scale and reliability. My focus is translating complex analytical needs (R\&D, Data Science, Product) into robust, cost-efficient, and fully automated data infrastructure.

### Key Focus & Quantified Impact

My work centers on improving performance and governance across the data lifecycle:

| Metric | Achievement | Architectural Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **70%** | Infrastructure Cost Reduction | Re-architected high-volume ingestion (EventHub → ADLS → Spark) |
| **3x** | Throughput Increase | Optimized batch and streaming ETL workflows |
| **\<5s** | Real-Time Latency | Engineered **MQTT/Kafka** low-latency microservices |
| **99.9%** | Production Uptime | Maintained fault-tolerant streaming via robust **Observability (Prometheus/Grafana)** |

###  Core Capabilities

* **Real-Time Data Pipelining:** Design and deployment of high-volume, low-latency streaming platforms (Kafka, Spark) to maintain **sub-5s latency** and **99.9% uptime**.  
* **Architectural Optimization:** Expertise in data platform governance, leading architectural refactoring to secure **70% infrastructure cost savings** and **3x data throughput**.  
* **DevOps & MLOps:** Hands-on experience with production deployments on **Kubernetes**, leveraging **Argo CD** for CI/CD and **KEDA** for dynamic autoscaling.  
* **Data Modeling & Governance:** Implementing advanced data ingestion strategies (**CDC, SCD Type-0**) and establishing a **centralized source of truth** for analytical reliability.  
* **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Spearheading initiatives to integrate enriched data into business dashboards, enabling **Data Science** initiatives, and actively mentoring junior engineers.

### Core Technology Stack

I primarily work across the cloud-native, modern data stack:

| Category | Skills & Technologies |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Big Data & Streaming** | Kafka, EventHub, Spark (PySpark), Polars, MQTT |
| **Data Warehousing** | ClickHouse, Snowflake, Delta Lake, PostgreSQL, MySQL |
| **Orchestration & ETL** | Apache Airflow, dbt, CDC, SCD Type-0 |
| **DevOps & MLOps** | Kubernetes, Docker, Argo CD, KEDA, CI/CD |
| **Languages** | Python (Advanced), SQL (Expert), Core Java |
